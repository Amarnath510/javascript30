## Reference
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D (Canvas Doc)
- To Enable autosuggest for JavaScript browser (HTML) features like document.(some-method) using TernJS we need to do the following,
  - First you need to be open a JS file. It won't work if you are in HTML file
  - Atom -> Toolbar -> packages -> Atom TernJS -> Configure Project -> "libs" section, check "browser" -> save & restart server
- To start tasks that have "package.json" do,
  - npm install
  - npm start
- Use `element.getBoundingClientRect()` to get element position coordinates(width, height, top, left etc).
