    let another_age = age;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const arrayCopyUsingSlice = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const arrayCopyUsingConcat = [].concat(players);

    // or use Array.from
    const arrayUsingArrayFrom = Array.from(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const arrayCopyUsingSpread = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    arrayCopyUsingSpread[3] = 'amar';
    console.log(arrayCopyUsingSpread, players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const anotherPerson = person;
    person.age = 90; // both will change
    console.log(person, anotherPerson);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const copyOfPerson = Object.assign({}, person);  // This only works for one level
    copyOfPerson.age = 100;
    console.log(person, copyOfPerson);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const deepCopyUsingJSON = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person)); // Costly operation. First converts to string and then the string is parsed to JSON.
    deepCopyUsingJSON.age = 60;
    console.log(person, deepCopyUsingJSON);
